PRIMIFY - A primer-picking script by Will Bradshaw
Latest version: 2.0.0 on April 25th 2016

Primify is a command-line primer-picking tool which:
 - Designs PCR and sequencing primers using primer3
 - Optionally selects the most specific primers found using BLAST
 - Parses the results into a user-friendly output file
By using pre-written configuration files containing primer3 options,
primify simplifies the process of configuring primer3. Using the wrapper
script primify_table, the tool can also automate the workflow for picking
multiple specific primer pairs from the same sequence file, greatly 
reducing the time required for reliable primer picking.

1: CONTENTS
-----------

In addition to this README file, primify consists of the following:
    1: primify - the main primer-picking script
    2: primify_table - wrapper script enabling simultaneous
        input of multiple targets
    3: primify_core - helper script for primer picking
    4: primify_check - helper script for specificity checking
    5: primify_out - Python helper script producing output file
    6: config - a directory containing built-in configuration files
N.B. It is not recommended to call scripts 3-5 directly.

---------------
2: INSTALLATION
---------------

To install primify, clone this repository to a local directory and
add it to your PATH. Make sure that all prerequisite programs are
also installed and in your PATH:

 - Python
 - BLAST command line application
 - primer3

--------
3: USAGE
--------

NB: More information on usage and options can be found by running
primify or primify_table with the -h option

To pick primer pairs from anywhere within a FASTA sequence, run

    primify [OPTIONS] SEQ_FILE

To pick only primers that flank a desired target region for PCR, run

    primify [OPTIONS] SEQ_FILE TARGET

where TARGET is formatted as START,LENGTH, i.e. the start co-ordinate
in the source sequence followed by the target length. In both cases,
use the -B option to specify that primer picking should be followed
by specificity checking using BLAST. To pick only forward or reverse
primers, use the -f and -r options respectively.

To pick multiple distinct primer pairs from the same sequence file, 
a tabular input file is required in which each line takes the form

    ID SEQ TARGET [INC]

where
    ID = file output prefix/ID for that primer search
    SEQ = sequence within the FASTA file from which to pick primers
    TARGET = target region as above
    INC = region from which to pick primers, in START,LENGTH format
if present, INC should be larger than and contain TARGET. The user can
decline to specify a target region by setting TARGET to 0,0.

Given such a target file, primify can be run by calling

    primify_table [OPTIONS] SEQ_FILE TABULAR_FILE

with -B, -f and -r having the same effects as before.

4: CONFIGURATION FILES
----------------------

To simplify the process of calling primer3 and improve the 
reproducibility and reliability of primer picking, primify uses
configuration files containing pre-specified options, which are passed
to primer3 during execution. These files can be found in the config
subdirectory of the primify directory. More information about primer3
options can be found in that programs documentation, but the most 
important options are:
    PRIMER_MIN_SIZE, PRIMER_OPT_SIZE, PRIMER_MAX_SIZE: set the minimum,
        optimal and maximum primer lengths in nucleotides
    PRIMER_MIN_TM, PRIMER_OPT_TM, PRIMER_MAX_TM: minimum, optimal and
        maximum acceptable melting temperatures (in degrees Celsius)
    PRIMER_MIN_GC, PRIMER_MAX_GC: minumum and maximum GC content
    PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_DIFF: maximum Tm difference between paired primers
    PRIMER_MAX_POLY_X: maximum polyN length in primer (i.e. maximum 
        number of the same nucleotide that can occur in a row)
    PRIMER_GC_CLAMP: required number of G/C nucleotides at the 3' end
    PRIMER_MAX_END_GC: maximum number of G/C nucleotides at the 3' end
    PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE: acceptable product size ranges

All of these can be edited to customise primer picking. Product size
ranges should be given as a space-separated list of the same form as

    150-250 100-300 301-400 401-500 ...

Primer3 will first try to find primers in the first range; if there are
not enough in that range, it will try the second, and so on.

Other parameters can also be added to the configuration file to 
customise primer picking (see primer3 documentation); however, the
following parameters are protected and should not be added, as they are
manipulated by primify:
    SEQUENCE_ID
    SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE
    PRIMER_NUM_RETURN
    PRIMER_THERMODYNAMIC_PARAMETERS_PATH
    SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION
    SEQUENCE_TARGET
    PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER
    PRIMER_PICK_LEFT_PRIMER

The configuration files provided by default with the current version of
primify are:

    seq: optimal conditions for Sanger sequencing primers
    seq_relaxed: less stringent conditions for Sanger sequencing primers
    seq_noclamp: as seq_relaxed, but without a 3' GC clamp
    race: preferred conditions for SMARTer RACE primers
    race_relaxed: less stringent conditions for SMARTer RACE primers
    lenient: general, non-stringent primer-picking parameters for PCR

By default, the seq configuration file is used when calling primer3.
To use one of the others, call one of

    primify -c <config_file> [OPTIONS] SEQ_FILE [TARGET]
    primify_table -c <config_file> [OPTIONS] SEQ_FILE TABULAR_FILE

To use your own configuration file, simply save it in the config
subdirectory and specify it in the script call as above.

---------
5. OUTPUT
---------

Each search performed by primify will return a primer3 report file
with name format ID_SEQ_TARGET_CONFIG.txt. In addition to these
report files, the primers/pairs found will be appended to an output
table file. The format of this output depends on the form of the
primer search:

1: Paired primers for PCR

    ID  "F"   F_SEQ   PRODUCT_SIZE  F_TM  F_POS   COORDS
    ID  "R"   R_SEQ                 R_TM  R_POS

where
    ID = The file output prefix / ID for that primer pair
    F/R_SEQ = The sequence of the forward/reverse primer
    PRODUCT_SIZE = The predicted size of the PCR product
    F/R_TM = The melting temperature of the forward/reverse primer
    F/R_POS = The starting co-ordinate of the forward/reverse primer
        on the searched sequence
    COORDS = The co-ordinates of the predicted PCR product (in
        START,LENGTH format) on the searched sequence

2: Forward primers only

    ID  "F"  F_SEQ  F_TM  F_POS

3: Reverse primers only

    ID  "R"  R_SEQ  R_TM  R_POS

At present, the format of the output file cannot be modified.

6. TODO
-------

- Add ability to customise output format
- Add troubleshooting section to README

Unfortunately, multithreading on command-line BLAST is not currently
available. If this feature is re-introduced, it will be added to 
primify (specificity checking, if enabled, is usually the bottleneck
step in the pipeline).
